          Suport for splitting the kernel into inner and outer regions.
          Processes marked as 'PKERNEL' run under vmx non-root mode, e.g. processes
          are virtualized, aka Dune, c.f. full machine virtualization.
          They enter the kernel in that mode too (outer-kernel mode)
          thus giving the 'inner kernel' (the code that runs in root-mode vmx)
          a control point where restrictions can be put in place, e.g. enforce
          something like a vMMU interface, as in 'Nested Kernel', Dautenhahn,
          et al.

          If in doubt, say "N".
